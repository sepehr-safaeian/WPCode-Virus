Step 1: The User Lands on Bellatrixmeissa.com
The scam process begins when the user lands on the Bellatrixmeissa.com site prompting them to enable notifications. As covered previously, several tactics are utilized to redirect users including:

Clicking on advertisements on streaming sites, file sharing platforms, adult sites, and other questionable sources
Downloading and installing software bundled with browser hijackers and adware
Clicks links in spam emails designed to mimic legitimate notifications
Redirect chains that eventually land on the Bellatrixmeissa.com domain
In many cases, the user is unaware they have been redirected to a dubious website. The page appears harmless at first glance, tricking the visitor into thinking Bellatrixmeissa.com is the source they initially tried accessing.

Step 2: The User is Prompted to Allow Notifications
After landing on the page, the user is presented with a video player window and a message prompting them to click “Allow” or “Continue.” The message varies but usually explains that notifications must be enabled to view the content.

The website relies on dubious claims to persuade users to enable notifications:

“Please ‘Allow’ to Watch Video”
“Click ‘Allow’ to Verify You’re Not a Robot”
“Enable Notifications to Continue”
“Turn on Notifications to Prove You’re Human”
These messages prey on user tendencies to enable notifications without considering the implications. If the prompt seems legitimate, most users will instinctively allow notifications to progress.

Step 3: Notifications Permission Grants Access
Once the user clicks “Allow” on the browser notification prompt, the Bellatrixmeissa.com scam immediately has permission to display disruptive pop-up messages.

Even if the browser is closed, notifications will persist thanks to push notification access. This allows cybercriminals to barrage the user with adult advertising, gambling promotions, and dubious malware alerts.

Notifications enabled also allows the website to:

Track browsing data for profiling and fraud purposes
Install browser extensions and addons without the user’s consent
Change the browser homepage and search engine defaults
Override pop-up blockers and security settings
Granting this website notification access gives scam operators the keys to deliver virtually any type of disruptive or malicious content.

Step 4: Malicious Pop-up Barrage Commences
Once notification access is granted, the user can expect an onslaught of unwanted pop-up messages. These intrusive ads will display both in the browser and directly on the desktop.

Some examples of pop-up notification spam victims may encounter include:

Adult dating and webcam model promotions
Flashy gambling ads with unrealistic earnings promises
Fake browser updates threatening to compromise security
Browser lockers with dubious call-to-action buttons
“Prize won” and “You are a winner” notification scams
The purpose is to expose users to high-risk advertising, collect browsing data, and redirect to affiliate offers. These pop-ups are very difficult to close and will bombard the victim with highly deceptive and inappropriate content.
