. Hiding Menus and Plugins (For Administrators):

The code checks if the current user is an administrator and if a specific parameter isn't set in the URL.
If those conditions are met, it hides elements related to the "WP Code Snippet Manager" plugin and some admin bar items using CSS.
This suggests the attacker might be trying to hide their tracks after modifying the site with the plugin.
2. Potential User Creation (For Non-Administrators):

The code checks for a specific cookie value (_pwsa) and another cookie named "pw".
If both cookies match, it further checks for additional cookies (c, u, p, e).
Based on the value of the "c" cookie, it might try to:
Update a WordPress option named "d" with the value from the "d" cookie (unclear purpose).
Create a new administrator user with details from cookies (u - username, p - password, e - email).
3. Login URL Check and Cookie Checks:

The code checks if the current URL is the login page and skips execution if it is.
It also checks for another cookie named "skip" and avoids running if it's set to "1".
4. User IP Detection and Blocking:

The code retrieves the user's IP address.
It checks a transient option named "exp" which likely stores blocked IPs and timestamps.
If the user's IP is already blocked within the last 24 hours, the code exits.
5. Potential DNS TXT Record Lookup and Redirect:

The code constructs a complex string based on the website hostname, user IP, and a random number.
It attempts to perform a DNS TXT record lookup for that string.
If the record exists and contains a base64 encoded string, it decodes it.
Depending on the decoded value:
"err": Blocks the user's IP for 24 hours.
Starts with "http": Redirects the user to that URL (potential phishing attempt).
